React is a library fo creating User Interface for different frontend apps.

Welcome to Academeez React course!  
React is a library fo creating User Interface for different frontend apps.  
Which means you can use React for building frontend apps like: web sites, native or hybrid mobile apps, desktop applications.  
In this FREE course for beginners and experts we will learn about React.

## What we can create with React

As stated we use React to build apps for the web, mobile, desktop, smarttv etc.  
We refer to whomever is running our app as **Platform**.  
Few examples:  
- If we are using React to build a website, our **Platform** is the **Browser**.
- If we are using React to build a native mobile apps, our **Platform** will be the **Smartphone** rather it's **iOS** or **Android**.

Since React can be used in multiple Platforms, we refer to `React` as Platform agnostic, meaning it can be used in various platforms for creating different frontend apps.

This fact is important cause it effects how we need to learn `React`

## Learning React means learning the core and platform specifics

In this course you will learn the Core principles of React but to learn them we must choose a platform as well.  
The platform we are going to choose is the **Browser**, and the apps we are going to build in this course are websites.  
Learning `React` means learning two aspects of the technology:

- **Core React** - this is the common aspects of `React`, no matter what you will use `React` for, rather build a mobile app or a website, the core concepts is similar to both.
- **Platform Specific** - those are rules that apply only to the **Platform** you choose to develop for.   
react rule that apply for the browser, will not necessarily apply to developing with React for the mobile

In this course we will use `React` for building websites so we will learn the **Core React** along with specific rules when using `React` for building a website.  
Many of the things we learn here, if they belong to the **Core** will apply to other platforms as well.

Let's start using React and build our amazing, and fast website.
