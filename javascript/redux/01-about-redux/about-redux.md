Redux is a Javascript state management library.  
It helps us manage the data in our app in a predictable way.  
Redux is commonly used in frontend apps.    

## Data/State

Our app will have data.  
Some of the data we are getting from the server.  
Some of the data we get from user interaction in our app.  
The data in our app will effect the view that we are seeing.  
Change in the data will often cause a change in the view.  
Redux stores our data, which is referred in Redux as state.  
Redux will help us change the data, in a predictable way which means we can easily track the data changes in our app, and we have a precise well defined ways of manipulating the data.  
We can connect our view to part of the state that interests us, and our view will be updated when the part of the state he is registered is changed.
