The most popular usage of Node.js, and where Node.js shines the most, is in creating backend http servers.

## What we will create

We will use Node.js for creating a backend http server.
Our server will passively listen for http request and will return for every request an http response.  
Our server will be connected to a database and query that database to return information saved in the database.  
Our server can return the response data in various formats:  
- We can build a [REST](https://academeez.com/node/rest) server
- We can return the response in [GraphQL](https://academeez.com/node/graphql)
- We can return static files
- We can return HTML

We will learn how to deal with the different common ways to return a response.
