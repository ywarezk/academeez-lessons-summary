Node.js is a Javascript runtime.
Meaning it can run scripts that are written in the Javascript programming language.

## A bit of history

Javascript used to be the scripting language of the web, and only web browsers could run Javascript.  
With Node.js we can now run Javascript in our computers, and outside of the browsers, and we can now use Javascript as a programming language for creating other stuff, not only internet web pages.

## What we can build with Node

Now that we have Node.js running outside of the web we can create more stuff with it.
We can create Desktop apps, Mobile apps, Command line apps, Backend server applications, connect to a database, and more.

## Where Node.js shine

Probably the most popular usage of Node.js is creating backend applications.  
Those are applications that run on a backend server, usually connected to a database.  
The majority of the backend application are http servers, those are servers that get a request in the form of http protocol request and returns response in the form on http response.
